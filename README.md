# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with color theme switcher solution

![](./public/screenshot.jpg)

This is a solution to the [REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.
I made this site with Astro, and vanilla CSS for the styling.
The site is live at [klrfl-countries.netlify.app](https://klrfl-countries.netlify.app).

## Overview

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

## development

This project uses PNPM, so install that first. After that you can clone this repo, then install all the deps, then running a development server:

```sh
# If you don't have pnpm
npm install -g pnpm

# If you use SSH
git clone git@github.com:Klrfl/rest-countries.git

# If you use HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/Klrfl/rest-countries.git

cd rest-countries
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
